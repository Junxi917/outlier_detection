# Anomaly Detection and Gap Filling System
This system is a machine learning system for outlier detection and gap filling on unitvariate and multivariate time-series data. This system provides different anomaly detection algotithm and gap filling detection. User can choose the right algorithm according their needs.After anomaly detection or gap filling the result will be showed throught data visulisation.This system provides functions such as image export and data visualization.
